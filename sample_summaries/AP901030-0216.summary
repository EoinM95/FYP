Title: British French Link Up Under Channel Tunnel
 Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two inch probe to connect two halves of a 31 mile undersea rail tunnel officials reported
Management sources at TransManche Link the construction consortium building the Chunnel the Channel Tunnel confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8 25 pm when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues
It is an example of what Europe is about British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in London
This is Europe in practice
The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802 who thought he could defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a land passage
The Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993
This is a hugely historic moment because it means in effect that Britain is no longer an island said a construction union official
The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours
The conservative Daily Express newspaper noted in its Wednesday editions that Britons would theoretically be able to walk to France for the first time since the last Ice Age
The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world s costliest tunnel
The meeting point was just over 13 miles southeast of Shakespeare Cliff the British terminus near the town of Dover and 10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte near Calais
