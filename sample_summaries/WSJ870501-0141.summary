Title:  The Americas Peruvian Rebels Supplant Army as Shield for Drug Producers By Tyler Bridges
 In the late 1970s poor farmers living in communities surrounding this small town began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca to meet the growing US demand for cocaine
Like thousands of other farmers in Peru s Upper Huallaga Valley they discovered that while cacao and coffee could give their families enough to eat coca could make them rich
Development workers farmers and priests in the area say that the rebels have steadily streamed into the Upper Huallaga a vast stretch of jungle northeast of Lima and the biggest coca growing zone in the world
But the guerrillas have discovered they can easily win support among farmers in the jungles of Upper Huallaga because of widespread anger generated by the US financed Peruvian anti drug campaign
While Washington has been quick to trumpet links between guerrillas and drug trafficking in other countries US officials downplay the connection between drugs and the Shining Path
Government officials from the anti drug police UMOPAR and the coca eradication unit CORAH sent into the region to wipe out drug production were often confined to their barracks by the army they simply were not allowed to carry on with their work
The army continued its raids against the Shining Path in one part of the valley but the drug growers were increasing production in several other parts while anti drug officials were virtually kept under lock and key
