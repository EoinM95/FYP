Title:  FT 24 APR 91 Commodities and Agriculture Botswana tries to loosen De Beers grip The world diamond cartel faces strong calls for change 
 NEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana the world s most important diamond producer in value terms and De Beers the South African group which controls 80 per cent of the market for rough uncut diamonds are taking much longer than expected
Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers exclusive sales contract so that part of their country s output can be sold independently of the South African group s international cartel
This would give Botswana its own market window to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market
Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer chairman of the group s Central Selling Organisation argues that if Botswana chose not to sell its production exclusively through his organisation the CSO s ability to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised
He said Because the major diamond producers freely consent to sell exclusively through one channel the CSO is able to preserve an orderly market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand
However IDC Holdings a London based group which claims to be the most experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO suggests the CSO s attitude is unreasonable and based on a conceptual argument with little substance in fact
In presentations to Botswana s Minerals Policy Committee and members of parliament IDC has been arguing that not only was it commercially essential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output but that the country had a political responsibility to do so
If Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production worth about USDollars 100m independently of the CSO which sells about Dollars 4bn worth a year from all over the world it would represent no threat to market stability IDC said
It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the CSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale of its diamonds
