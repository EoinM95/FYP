Title: Loss Of Johnson s Gold Wounds Canadian Pride
 The stripping of Ben Johnson s Olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky
It s like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car said Pat Reid the Canadian high jump coach
The spirit of a nation raced with Johnson when he won the gold medal in the 100 meters on Saturday with a world record time of 9.79 seconds
Dr. George Astaphan Johnson s personal physician and Larry Heidebrecht Johnson s agent insisted the sprinter had not taken stanzolol
Johnson a 26 year old Jamaican transplant waved the Canadian flag in triumph and dedicated his gold to his mother and all Canadian citizens
It was unheroic conduct for the world s fastest human who had been awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabeth at the Commonwealth Games
Johnson s disgrace was heralded in Canadian headlines such as Fool s Gold Black Day For Canada Seconds Of Glory Years Of Shame From Fame To Shame and Big Ben is Now Has Ben
Trent Frayne sports columnist for the Globe and Mail of Toronto said Johnson s victory was the biggest event in Canada since a national team beat the Soviet Union in a seven game hockey series in 1972
