Title:  FT 29 APR 93 World Bank pledges drive to cut poverty Preston fails to respond to demands from Clinton to set more precise targets 
 MR Lewis Preston World Bank president yesterday promised to strengthen the bank s efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries
Poverty reduction must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development institution is judged he said
However he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus
In congressional testimony this week Mr Lloyd Bentsen US treasury secretary said the US wanted to see more funding that will create social and economic safety nets for poor people most affected by war civil strife and economic mismanagement
In fiscal 1992 nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures in spite of calls from Mr Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief
The share of bank lending allocated for human resource development is still only 14 per cent in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for an increased emphasis on investment in people
At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress a decade ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on poverty
