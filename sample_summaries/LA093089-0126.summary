Title:  SENATE VOTES TO PROHIBIT COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS 
 In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count
The city has been lobbying hard to have its illegal alien population estimated at 50 000 included in the 1990 count
The Senate s action came on a voice vote despite arguments from the Bush Administration and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable
Just before the voice vote the senators voted 50 to 41 against killing the proposal to bar aliens from the count
A Senate House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped from a 17.4 billion appropriations bill for the State Justice and Commerce departments
Mosbacher has said that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk with such a provision
State officials have said California could lose up to 300 million in federal aid if illegal aliens were uncounted
Councilman John Acosta said he was saddened by the Senate s action because the city was determined to count every single person and I know that now we re going to to suffer from this monetarily
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate with Minority Leader Bob Dole R Kan. arguing against the White House position on grounds that including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens
