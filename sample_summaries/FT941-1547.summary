Title:  FT 24 MAR 94 Commodities and Agriculture Germany sets scientist to work on BSE threat 
 The German government yesterday announced the launch of a new research project to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE can be transmitted to human beings
The initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban on British beef imports arguing that there is still no conclusive evidence that the disease cannot affect humans
Seven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by the country s research and technology ministry to examine possible connections between the origins of BSE and two other diseases Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome which very rarely affect humans
