Title:  BUSH PICKS CONSERVATIVE BLACK TO FILL MARSHALL S SHOES ON COURT 
 But Thomas who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap conservatism would present a striking change from Marshall a civil rights pioneer and an anchor of the court s declining liberal faction
Now the question is to what extent Thomas would add weight to the court s new majority that appears willing to dismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build
While not much is known about Thomas views on most issues likely to come before the court he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences
