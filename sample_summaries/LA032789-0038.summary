Title:  ALASKA TANKER PILOTED BY UNQUALIFIED OFFICER EXXON UNABLE TO EXPLAIN CAPTAIN S ABSENCE RISING WINDS STIR FEARS OF OIL SLICK DAMAGE 
 An unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez violating both Coast Guard regulations and company policy when the tanker crashed into rocks unleashing the worst oil spill in US history Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday
Exxon also disclosed that the Long Beach bound tanker actually was involved in two separate accidents that night in pristine Prince William Sound
Meanwhile winds kicked up around the crippled ship stirring fears that choppy waters could destabilize the Exxon Valdez and sweep the slick ashore
Wildlife experts were summoned from California to coordinate any efforts to rescue birds and sea otters whose feathers and fur make them the most vulnerable to oil contamination
Oil Covered Birds Otters Biologists already have counted 95 birds and two otters covered with oil but were unable to capture them for cleaning
Steve Cowper declared Prince William Sound a disaster area freeing state resources for cleanup and paving the way for a federal disaster declaration
Still unexplained is why Third Mate Gregory Cousins was steering the 987 foot vessel through the tricky iceberg dotted waters on Friday
Joseph Hazelwood was one flight below the bridge in his cabin when the Exxon Valdez hit the first jagged rock pinnacle about a mile outside shipping lanes
The ship then slid about two miles under full power and hit more underwater rocks Iarossi said
Iarossi said he did not know whether Hazelwood took the wheel after the first accident or how much time elapsed between the two incidents
There would have been no reason for the 42 year old captain to go below to use the bathroom or get coffee since both are available on the bridge Iarossi said
Cousins a three year employee of Exxon did not have the Coast Guard certification required to pilot through the sound but was qualified under other circumstances to steer the ship Iarossi said
Puts Off Filing Charges We re not going to file any charges until we are done with our investigation said Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson
Nelson said piloting a ship without proper certification is a civil not criminal violation which ultimately could result in suspension or revocation of the captain s license
She said it might be too perilous to try to capture panicky birds and otters from boats in the frigid water and there is no road access to the shores where they are likely to show up
A monitor from the US Fish and Wildlife Service said he felt encouraged about impact on the area s abundant marine life after patrolling the 50 square mile slick by boat Saturday
The reason we haven t seen a large number of birds affected so far is that the oil is out in the middle of the sound said Everett Robinson Wilson the agency s environmental contaminant coordinator
