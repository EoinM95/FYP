Title:  ALASKA GOVERNOR THREATENS OIL SHUTDOWN OVER CLEANUP 
 Backed by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster Gov
Steve Cowper on Thursday threatened to close down the trans Alaska oil pipeline unless its owners meet his terms for improved safety and cleanup measures
At the same time it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the possibility that Exxon s 987 foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and contributed to the accident
After meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil companies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week Cowper asked them to respond by noon Thursday to his six point safety plan
An aide to the governor described the companies response as generally OK but said that Cowper may issue an order putting his plan into effect anyway

To reduce the risk the order which could be issued as soon as today would require A written description due within 72 hours of the order s being signed of the location of all oil spill gear at the consortium s disposal
Meanwhile the chairman of Exxon Corp. told Congress Thursday that the third mate who was on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground has told company lawyers that he turned off the ship s automatic pilot in an effort to avoid the reef
