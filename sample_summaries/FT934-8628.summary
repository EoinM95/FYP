Title:  FT 15 NOV 93 Virginian congressmen feel the Nafta heat Nancy Dunne sees protesters trying to influence the vote on Wednesday 
 IN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate opposition but football apparently still is the reigning obsession
A not this Nafta rally on Saturday provided little competition for the college game of the century Florida State University against Notre Dame
The organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia s three wavering congressmen that a yes vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be remembered in November 
That is next November s mid term elections when those assembled mostly followers of Texas billionaires of Mr Ross Perot and union members would unite to throw the rascals out of office
We are absolutely for free trade says Mr Bill Diggitt the state director of Mr Perot s United We Stand
He says he is concerned about the loss of Virginia s tax base as companies move production to Mexico and place continuous downward pressure on wages
