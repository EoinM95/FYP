Title: Canadian Athlete Stripped Of Olympic Gold Medal For Steroid Use
 Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today in a complete state of shock accused of cheating with drugs in the world s fastest 100 meter dash and stripped of his gold medal
Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field
In a middle of the night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials family members coach and manager Johnson 26 forfeited his most prized possession the medal he d had in his hands for only three days
Johnson s name will go down in Olympic history with other athletes who lost their gold medals such as decathlete Jim Thorpe in 1912 because he played semi pro baseball and swimmer Rick DeMont in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine
