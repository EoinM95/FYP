Title: Gigantic Tunnel Project Inches Toward Joining England and France
 A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover pursuing a dream born in Napoleon s time that is coming true at last
Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world
The 31 mile tunnel 24 miles of it underwater will cut the London Paris journey from six hours to three as fast as a scheduled airline
Tunneling speed at the Dover end is less than 15 feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex French end moves even slower which is why the tunnel will not open until 1993
For continental Europeans accustomed to long distance rail travel the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching to Moscow and beyond
State owned British Rail will not commit itself to building a high speed link from London to the tunnel in time to make the three hour journey a reality in 1993
With trade barriers among the 12 EEC countries set to fall in 1992 Colin Kirkland technical director of Eurotunnel s on the British side says the tunnel will be completed this time
