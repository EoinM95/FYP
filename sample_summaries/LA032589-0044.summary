Title:  TANKER SPILLS OIL AFTER HITTING REEF OFF ALASKA 
 A Long Beach bound Exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef Friday and spilled an estimated 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska s Prince William Sound a pristine Pacific waterway heavily used by kayakers fishermen and tourists
The Exxon Valdez a 987 foot tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Co. rammed the reef about 25 miles from the city of Valdez the northernmost ice free port in the United States at 12 30 am Coast Guard officers speculated that the ship s captain may have been trying to avoid icebergs from the nearby Columbia Glacier when the accident occurred
Leak a Mere Trickle A representative of the US Fish and Wildlife Service said the tanker had been spilling oil at a rate of 10 000 barrels an hour but the Coast Guard said the leak had become a mere trickle by 2 30 pm Alaska time
US Coast Guard Petty Officer John Gonzales said in a telephone interview from Valdez that the spill was staying in the mid channel and did not seem to be moving toward the shore
But environmentalists feared that if the oil reached the shore marine birds would be threatened
Another Exxon tanker was attempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel and two Coast Guard investigators were on board the Valdez he said
Jon Nelson a deputy regional director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage said the reef ripped a 150 foot gash in the vessel which was carrying 1.2 million barrels of oil and there was fear that the tanker could break apart further
