Title:  Northwest Jet That Crashed in Detroit Had Engine Problems in Prior Years A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
 The Northwest Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in Detroit killing at least 154 people was involved in two incidents of engine failure in the past two years
According to Federal Aviation Administration records the McDonnell Douglas Corp
MD 82 jet made emergency landings in 1985 and 1986 following the loss of power in one of its two engines
A Northwest spokesman confirmed that the incidents happened but said they weren t related to Sunday s crash of Flight 255
Though federal investigators were looking into a number of possible causes for the crash which occurred shortly after takeoff engine failure appeared to be a likely culprit
According to Associated Press reports some witnesses to the crash including an air traffic controller said they saw blue flame coming from one of the jetliner s engines just before it hit the ground and exploded into a fireball
The accident the second deadliest ever in the US could have a broad range of effects on the airline industry regardless of the specific causes aviation specialists said
Following a summer of near misses delays and other snafus some airline specialists said the accident could serve as a catalyst for a reassessment of the nation s air travel system
There is going to be a lot of noise from Capitol Hill said John Galipault president of the Aviation Safety Institute
This one is going under the microscope
In Detroit federal crash inspectors and representatives of United Technologies Corp. s Pratt Whitney unit the engine maker arrived at the accident scene
Officials said that the aircraft s flight recorders which record cockpit conversations had been found in wreckage that extended over half a mile
The MD 82 jet which has a good safety record is designed to be able to take off and land even if one engine fails
In April the National Transportation Safety Board urged the FAA to conduct a safety investigation of the 200 series of JT8D engines after some dangerous in flight engine failures
The board made the recommendation after a March 23 incident in which an American Airlines MD 82 plane approaching the Minneapolis airport experienced an engine surge and loss of power
John Lauber one of five members of the National Transportation Safety Board said at a news conference at a hotel near the airport last night that there was no evidence at this point that either engine exploded or caught fire during flight
