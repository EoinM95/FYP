Title:  FT 30 MAR 93 Survey of the Republic of Slovenia 1 The Balkans lucky ones Though the country has suffered economically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the war in the Balkans independence has given its 2m inhabitants the opportunity to build an open market economy and democratic institutions 
Since Slovenia s declaration of independence in June 1991 the gap between the peaceful ethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war impoverished rest of former Yugoslavia has widened inexorably
We have been very lucky says President Milan Kucan the wily former communist who led Slovenia s drive for independence from the Serb dominated federation
But he like Mr Janez Drnovsek the prime minister of Slovenia s three pronged coalition government makes clear that Slovenia suffers economically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and would be one of the principal gainers from a resolution of the bloody Balkan imbroglio
Independence has above all brought peace to Slovenia and left it free to implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war further south
On the positive side of the balance sheet however the end of the federal state means that Slovenia no longer has to contribute over Dollars 1bn a year to finance the bloated Yugoslav army or see its hard currency deposits frozen by the National Bank of Yugoslavia as happened before independence
