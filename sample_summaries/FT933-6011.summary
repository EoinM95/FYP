Title:  FT 31 AUG 93 Read Clinton s lips No more welfare America 
 President Bill Clinton s pledge to end welfare as we know it was one of the most popular lines in last year s election campaign
His idea of a strict two year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters especially Reagan democrats not just as a way of cutting government spending and thus reducing taxes but as a solution to the nation s most pressing social problems

Since becoming president Mr Clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former President George Bush s read my lips no new taxes pledge
The White House insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just had to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities the deficit reduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform scheduled for September
