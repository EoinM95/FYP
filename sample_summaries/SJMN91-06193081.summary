Title:  LIGHT SHOW ECLIPSE OF MILLENNIUM DAZZLES MILLIONS DESPITE QUIRKS 
 From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible
In Hawaii Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse
And in the Bay Area more than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at 11 20 am The world will not see such a long lasting eclipse for another 151 years
It looks like someone took a bite out of an apple said Matthew Mauranoh 8 of Mountain View who peered through a homemade black box at the Foothill Observatory
In the 160 mile wide swath from Hawaii to Baja to Mexico to Brazil the morning turned into night the only region where the eclipse made the Earth totally dark
Clouds obscured eclipse As totality arrived at sea level on the Big Island the sun was hidden by a cloud layer
At the astronomy observatory at the top of 13 800 foot Mauna Kea high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the 10 scientific experiments
I came especially for this and hope we get to see it said Margaret MacLeod a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii
