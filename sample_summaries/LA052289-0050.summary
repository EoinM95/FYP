Title:  RENEWAL AT YELLOWSTONE FIRE RULES AFFECTED CONTROVERSY STILL SMOLDERS AT YELLOWSTONE 
 This has always been a land of stark contrasts and magnificent subtleties never more so than in the aftermath of last summer s spectacular season of fire which scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size
From the sky where the graceful bald eagles soar the oldest and grandest of our national parks now resembles a peculiar marble cake baked by the caprice of nature into patternless swirls of vegetation and death
Much Unscathed Despite infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces most of the pristine landscape emerged unscathed as did the elusive grizzly bears in the high country the resilient herds of elk and bison and the famous geysers that fill the air with eerie puffs of steam and mist
But cut into the green are huge gashes of once thriving forest that now appear either pitch black or rusty brown depending on whether the trees were roasted or merely singed
He turns a spade of blackened earth and finds rich brown soil just beneath the crust a sign that the forest not only remains fertile but will soon be teeming with new life
But while the 1988 blazes have long since flamed out the controversy they kindled is still smoldering
Arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and others in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow been reduced to cinders
On the one hand they are supposed to be preserves of the past the last outposts in America where nature is allowed to take its course with as little intrusion as possible from man
If nothing else said James Agee a forest ecology specialist at the University of Washington the furor raised by the fires should force environmentalists to temper their purist approach to park management
The Interior Department parent of the National Park Service has already ordered a summer long moratorium on its politically sensitive let burn policy under which lightning triggered blazes are allowed to burn unless they threaten human lives or property
Under the changes expected to be announced shortly by Bush Administration officials all parks would have to run through a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather moisture winds and available firefighting crews before they could make a decision on whether or not to let a lightning fire burn
