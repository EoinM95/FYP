Title:  FT 22 OCT 93 World Trade News US ready to back Nafta bank White House steps up campaign on pact with aid for affected communities 
 THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement
The so called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban Torres who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support adjustment throughout the continent
Agreement by the administration is expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into the pro Nafta fold
It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a reason favourable constituent mail to vote for the pact and it is pushing feverishly to turn anti Nafta public opinion around
