Title:  CLINIC BLOCKADERS CHARGE BRUTALITY OPERATION RESCUE SAYS ITS CHARGES OF MISTREATMENT BY POLICE HAVE BEEN IGNORED 
 In mid June a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was settled when police agreed to stop using a martial arts weapon nunchakus while arresting anti abortion advocates
Hundreds have charged that police in more than 50 cities have used excessive force in removing demonstrators intent on closing down abortion facilities
The demonstrators most associated with Operation Rescue have charged and testified that police tactics used during the past 2 1 2 years in cities such as Denver Atlanta Pittsburgh and Los Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against women who have been arrested
The persistent complaints and numerous suits against police by Operation Rescue have taken on a new significance in recent months in the wake of the Los Angeles police beating of motorist Rodney King
But government agencies the press and civil libertarians have reacted quite differently to Operation Rescue videos showing apparent police brutality and to reports of police abuse of hundreds of the activists across the country
