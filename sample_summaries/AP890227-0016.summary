Title: Tornado Deaths Below Average in 88
 One of nature s most vicious spectacles the tornado is poised to renew its annual assault on America as changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters
Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths but even so more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation
In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long term average of 99 fatalities annually the National Weather Service reported on Sunday
There is no way of knowing what this tornado season will bring but the way to survive is through preparedness said Ed Ferguson deputy director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City
Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in recent years to increased public awareness of the storms which are most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year
