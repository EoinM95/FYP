Title:  SENATE VOTES TO BAR COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS 
 In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count
The action came on a voice vote despite arguments from the Bush Administration and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable
Just before the voice vote the senators voted 50 to 41 against killing the proposal to bar aliens from the count
A Senate House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped from a 17.4 billion appropriations bill for the State Justice and Commerce departments
At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California Florida New York Illinois Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis of next year s census
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate with Minority Leader Bob Dole R Kan. arguing against the White House position on grounds that including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens
