Title:  FT 11 MAY 92 World Bank links loan volume to poverty relief 
 THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country s efforts to fight poverty according to an operational directive to staff issued today by Mr Lewis Preston the bank s president
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank s central mission in the 1990s
The shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third world allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty
In the directive Mr Preston says poverty reduction is the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured
