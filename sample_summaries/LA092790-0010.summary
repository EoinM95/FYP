Title:  PERSPECTIVES ON TERM LIMITATIONS . . . NO IT LL SHIFT POWER TO THE UNELECTED SURE VOTERS ARE ANGRY. BUT INTEREST GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN AGENDAS ARE FUNNELING THE ANGER TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT. 
 Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so according to the pundits and the polls
Contrary to most of the propaganda on the subject these constitutional changes won t do what their proponents say they want to accomplish
For example term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections
Forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have
Veteran members proven vote getters are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment
