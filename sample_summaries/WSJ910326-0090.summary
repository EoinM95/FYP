Title:  He Paints Still Lifes But John Kelley 83 Is Still on the Move He Lives for Boston Marathon Which He ll Be in April 15 Running His 60th Race 
 Mr
Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon his 60th Boston Marathon
Bill Rodgers a four time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year marvels at Mr. Kelley It s incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he s doing
Even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of Mr. Kelley s rivals of yesteryear gasping
Aghast is more like it says Leslie Pawson 86 a three time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a century ago
John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare
A two time winner in Boston 1935 and 1945 and runner up seven times Mr. Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year as he has been for 15 years
Two state troopers will run alongside the 5 foot 6 130 pound Mr. Kelley into Boston so he won t be trampled by groupies as he calls them clamoring to shake his hand
Of course Mr. Kelley not to be confused with the other John Kelley who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 isn t the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race in 2 hours 32 minutes 7 seconds
When John Kelley first toed the line in 1928 George Bush wasn t yet in kindergarten Joe DiMaggio was an unknown and Nike was the winged goddess of victory not a running shoe
