Title: Study Blacks More Susceptible than Whites to Tuberculosis
 Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease according to a study today
The research found that when living conditions are identical black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria
We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks said Dr. William W
Another soon to be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB bacteria which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis
