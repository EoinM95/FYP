 Thus began another chapter in one of medicine s most bizarre mysteries a tale of sick sheep and mad cows cannibals and Pennsylvanians ancient life forms and a cat named Max
The plot revolves around a family of brain diseases probably variations of a single disorder called spongiform encephalopathy
