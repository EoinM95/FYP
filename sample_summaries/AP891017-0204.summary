Title: Area Where Earthquake Hit Seen as Highly Probable in 1988 Report
 The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California
A 1988 report by the US Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains
The high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906 said Clarence Allen professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena
It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area Allen said
