Title:  Politics Policy Report on Los Angeles Police Department Finds Racism Suggests Changes Gates s Resignation 
 While the commission stopped short of blaming Chief Gates for these problems it said that no chief should serve more than two consecutive five year terms and that Mr. Gates having served 13 years should therefore turn in his badge following a transition period
Nearly one quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community and in some cases may lead to the use of excessive force the report said
A scant eight hours is devoted to cultural awareness training at the Los Angeles Police Academy and many officers who train new recruits in the field openly perpetuate the siege mentality that alienates patrol officers from the community the commission concluded
But the commission called for a shift away from the force s paramilitaristic us against them style and said the department must embrace the community based policing style that encourages officers to spend less time in their cars and more time interacting with citizens in the communities they serve
This report will be a must read for police chiefs around the country said Hubert Williams executive director of the Police Foundation a Washington DC law enforcement research group
However the commission didn t address how Los Angeles would pay for this major overhaul though Mr. Christopher said that when you see the costs of settlements accelerating in police misconduct lawsuits as they have in recent years I m not sure there will be a net cost increase to implement the changes
