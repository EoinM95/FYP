Tom Foley a liberal Democrat from Washington State calls him a very strong asset to the 151 nation institution because of the enormous respect he has on both sides of the aisle
After a year and a half in office he has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem
The World Bank has been reluctant to step out on this issue in confrontation and conflict with the Treasury charges Sen
There surely is a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem than it has played so far but they just can t get out ahead of the administration he says
While the debt morass has deepened Mr. Conable s World Bank has looked inward shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a 74.8 billion increase in its capital
As Congress considers the increase liberal critics on Capitol Hill are demanding that Mr. Conable show he is ready to use the bank s vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of Third World debt
House Democrats in fact cut out of the foreign aid bill passed last month all 70 million the administration had sought for the first year of the US share of the increase in capital
He has clung to the bank s traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked him for his job US Treasury Secretary James Baker

Jeffrey Sachs a Harvard economist who has offered one of many debt reduction plans says the World Bank s officials have the great potential to play a central role in the problem but they re basically ducking
While financial experts often urge the bank to do more the ponderous institution has intervened only about half a dozen times in debt crises usually just to guarantee a small portion of a commercial bank loan package
The likelihood is that the bank will need to play a more extensive and diversified role in two areas new money packages and facilitating other forms of financial relief including debt reduction schemes declares the study which was drafted by David Bock a vice president and the bank s debt expert
