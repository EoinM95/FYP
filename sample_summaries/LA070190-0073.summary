Title:  MR. TORNADO DEVOTES LIFE TO UNDERSTANDING NATURE S AWESOME DESTRUCTIVE POWER 
Since then my passion really went up said Fujita a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world s foremost authorities on the violent storms
Fujita 69 spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research
He creates tornadoes over a large fan which makes a swirling motion another fan above simulates a low pressure system by adding an updraft to the mix
Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953 partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country
