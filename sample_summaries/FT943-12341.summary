Title:  FT 26 JUL 94 Technology Waiting for the big one There is growing scepticism about Japan s earthquake prediction programme 
 Some 160km west of Tokyo in Japan s coastal Tokai region is what may be the world s most dense array of geophysical instruments
The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts to be summoned at a moment s notice will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake
If the committee so advises Japan s prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area
And then everyone will wait for an earthquake measuring eight on the Richter scale
Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m Pounds 1.6m a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research
For prediction believers it is a small price to pay as Japan is one of the world s most earthquake prone countries
Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction
