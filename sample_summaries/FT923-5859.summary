Title:  FT 28 AUG 92 Commodities and Agriculture Oppenheimer to visit Moscow as diamond shake up looms 
 MR HARRY Oppenheimer whose family effectively controls the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and De Beers is to visit Russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake up in its diamond industry
His visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife with rumours about unofficial exports from Russia contributing to the present market turmoil which might force De Beers to cut its dividend payment this year
Some industry observers suggest that the presence in Russia of Mr Oppenheimer who will be 84 in October will be timely
However it admitted that Mr Oppenheimer would be meeting senior officials from the Russian diamond industry during his stay because he would be going to some of the big mines in Siberia and would be present when De Beers held the formal opening of its Moscow office on September 8
