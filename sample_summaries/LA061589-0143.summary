Title:  US REACTION BEN JOHNSON S 100 METER RECORD SHOULDN T STAND ATHLETES AND OFFICIALS SAY 
 Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100 meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis many US track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use
Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven year involvement with illegal performance enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds
I would have to see the evidence but if he was on drugs at the time of the World Championships my thought would be to remove his record said Ollan Cassell executive director of The Athletics Congress the national governing board for the sport
The possibility that Johnson could lose his record was raised when the IAAF asked for an urgent legal opinion to see what it could do about records and championships of confessed drug users
Frank Greenberg TAC president said We ll wait to see what Canada does following the country s inquiry at which 40 persons among them Johnson his coach Charlie Francis and his physician Jamie Astaphan testified
I feel we will do our best to advocate that our athlete Carl Lewis gets the world record Greenberg said
