Title: Some Fires in National Forests Brought Under Control
 Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided a much needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared 1 650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming and rainfall in neighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller fires there
Meanwhile illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2 200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California over the weekend and firefighters brought a four day fire in Michigan s Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday after the blaze consumed more than 1 100 acres
About a quarter inch of rain helped to keep the lightning caused Shoshone fire s growth to about 200 acres overnight said fire information officer Dave Damron
