Title:  LONG BEACH MARATHON WILSON YANMIN HAVE THE PATIENCE TO WIN WITH COURSE RECORDS 
 Patience is often difficult to muster for those who run the 26.2 miles of a marathon
The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and get a head start on recovering from it
Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday as the men s and women s winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race to burn through and take a toll on the runners
Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself out took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds a course record
The old record of 2 13 22 was set in 1986 by Ric Sayre
Wen Yanmin a 23 year old student from Bejing China picked her way through a strung out pack and out kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2 43 33 also a course record
Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race for total prize money of 9 500 each
