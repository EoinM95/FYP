Title: Crowds Drawn By Wonder of Partial Solar Eclipse
 Solar telescopes yielded views of flare producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America
There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature said Ed Krupp director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun s surface at 10 50 am PST
It s kind of neat said map maker Jan Mayne who was among dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena
As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse those watching through Caltech s telescopes could see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun
Also visible were gas jets on the sun s surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare a burst of heat and radiation since 1984
