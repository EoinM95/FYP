Title:  FT 27 NOV 93 Guns n poses George Graham examines an important victory for US advocates of tougher firearms laws 
After seven long years the US Congress this week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations of Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968
The legislation known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady the former White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan would impose a five day waiting period on purchases of handguns
Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho and Alaska who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the US
They point to glaring failings in the federal government s policing of the 276 000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill s likely ineffectiveness
But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of new or used firearms let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation and will barely affect the more than 14 000 murders and 1 400 accidental deaths involving guns each year
In Virginia meanwhile Ms Mary Sue Terry the Democratic candidate for governor relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by Mr George Allen her Republican opponent who did not favour tighter curbs but promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole
