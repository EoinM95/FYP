Title:  LIGHTS OUT. ECLIPSE WILL DIM DAYLIGHT HERE LEAVE OTHERS IN THE DARK 
Solar eclipses occur twice a year when the sun moon and earth line up
This line up would occur at every new moon except that the moon s orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun s path every six months
In these cases the moon s shadow up to 200 miles wide on the earth s surface races west to east along the ground at 1 000 to 5 000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles
But when the shadow s narrow path does cross inhabited areas people flock there to experience totality to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on and to gaze at the sun s shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns
