Title:  Back to Life Yellowstone Park Begins Its Renewal Research Biologist Despain Roots Around in the Ash Finds Reasons for Cheer 
Almost everything in sight is black from the tips of trees 40 feet above the ground to the powdered ash blanketing the earth
Where many people recoil at the sweep of nature s destructive power the 47 year old Mr. Despain marvels at the tiny steps life is already taking to renew itself
As Yellowstone National Park s research biologist he has already begun to monitor the forest s rebirth from the worst fire on record
But next spring many of the seeds fertilized by nutrients leaching into the soil from the snow packed ash will sprout along with a bouquet of grasses flowers and shrubs as burnt areas of the park erupt with life
The profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires largely quenched this week by rain and snow still smolder
Grasses and several types of wildflowers ranging from fireweed to wild geraniums are already sprouting less than seven weeks after fire roared past Grant Village near Yellowstone Lake
Next year the ground cover replacing the park s burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30 fold increase in plant species
We see what s going on here not as devastation and destruction but rather rebirth and renewal of these ecosystems says John Varley Yellowstone s chief of research and Mr. Despain s boss
The National Park Service has already been at the center of a much publicized political firestorm over its 16 year old natural burn policy which allows lightning caused fires to burn themselves out except where they threaten towns or park buildings
Critics including elected officials from Western states and the logging and tourist industries have grabbed headlines by blaming that policy for fueling the inferno that this summer raged over half of Yellowstone s 2.2 million acres and cost more than 100 million to fight and clean up
Reforestation would give wooded areas in Yellowstone a five year jump on natural regrowth of the woods and would get it green again says John Davis Willamette Industries Inc. s general manager for Western timber logging operations in Lewiston Idaho
