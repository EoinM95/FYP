Title:  FT 25 OCT 93 Welfare versus wealth of nations Governments are anxious to cut the cost of pensions healthcare and benefit payments 
 The welfare state the glue that binds the social fabric of the world s advanced capitalist economies is coming unstuck
The immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development
Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992
In the longer term there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years
While short term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war
Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD as countries struggle to rein in government spending
Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990
The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions healthcare unemployment benefits and family support
The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions
Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period
The growth is largely attributable to three factors The increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second world war mature
The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the doubling of health expenditure since 1960
As with pensions health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth for example including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental
Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low income families
But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers
Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes
Although there are considerable differences between national health systems healthcare reforms in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models that use competition and price incentives to control costs
Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these
But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future
Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms
