Title:  FT 29 APR 91 Challenge to foster human capital As bankers and finance ministers gather in Washington the World Bank looks for fresh vigour under a new chief 
 How can 6 000 civil servants mostly based in Washington best promote development in the Third World
That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston the former chairman of J P Morgan the New York bank who takes over as president of the World Bank this September
As bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund there was no shortage of advice
The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector
The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali s European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRD and attach strict political conditions to its loans
Development economists meanwhile are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year s World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation
Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed new imperatives such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East have merely been superimposed on older unsolved problems Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day
It is not an impressive bureaucracy says Mr John Williamson a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics
Mr Preston s first challenge says Mr Mistry will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi his second to prune legions of useless advisers and install managers with real world experience
The Brady plan is enough says Mr Williamson if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt
