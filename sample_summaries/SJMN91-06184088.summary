Title:  THOMAS FACES TOUGH SCRUTINY DEMOS WANT ANSWERS ON THE DIVISIVE ISSUES 
Howard Metzenbaum D Ohio said the Senate Judiciary Committee in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion has given them a free ride and should be tougher in ferreting out Thomas views
The failure to give an answer may cause me and others to be unwilling to vote for his confirmation Metzenbaum said on CBS This Morning
I do not think it is appropriate to ask a nominee the ultimate question as to how he is going to decide a specific case Specter said
I will not support yet another Reagan Bush Supreme Court nominee who remains silent on a woman s right to choose and then ascends to the court to weaken that right said Metzenbaum the only member of the Judiciary Committee who voted against Thomas nomination to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia
Orrin Hatch R Utah said on NBC s Today show that literally nobody nominated for the Supreme Court should give his or her views with regard to cases that might come up in the future
