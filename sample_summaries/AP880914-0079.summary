Title: Sheets Smooth in Rough Waters
 As Hurricane Gilbert s record breaking fury sends Caribbean islanders scrambling for cover National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets remained calm at his helm
The barometric pressure at the storm s center plummeted to 26.13 inches at 5 58 pm EDT Tuesday night making Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure but Sheets handled a mob of reporters with ease
With his schedule of interviews timed to the minute Sheets spent most of Tuesday on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive Gilbert in full color sprawled across much of the western Caribbean
The transition from former director Neil Frank widely known for his distinctive style and flat top haircut to Sheets his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray wool blend jacket has been smooth
