Title:  FT 24 MAR 94 World Trade News Neighbours line up at the door of Nafta Caribbean basin nations hope for help to ease the pain 
 Central American and Caribbean governments are awaiting with more than passing interest an imminent US statement on measures to cushion the economic dislocation which the region expects from the North American Free Trade Agreement
However Washington s proposals promised by Mr Alexander Watson assistant secretary of state for inter American affairs are likely to disappoint Caribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive package to allow free access to the US and Canadian markets
The US proposals could also be at a cost to the region say some Caribbean officials
Claiming that a more competitive Mexico with free access to the US and Canada will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developed under current trade agreements the region has asked for parity with Mexico in exporting to Nafta signatories
Some regional government officials and US legislators supportive of the Caribbean s concerns which include the possible diversion of investments to Mexico have now concluded that what would amount to a de facto extension of Nafta is unlikely
Mr Clinton and his Mexican counterpart Mr Carlos Salinas assured the Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected by the implementation of Nafta and that efforts would be made to protect their markets in the US and Canada
What the Caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators in Washington and then in Ottawa and Mexico City to ratify proposals by some US congressmen to put all the region s exports to the US and Canada on a par with Mexico s
The parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an open door to the Nafta market for three years
