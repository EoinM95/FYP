Title: Study Recommends TB Treatment for AIDS Infected Addicts
 Drug abusers who are infected with the AIDS virus and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent full blown TB says a study published today
Doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in recent years among people at high risk of AIDS especially drug addicts
In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections not new exposures to the bacteria in people who also are infected with the AIDS virus
The doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting tuberculosis themselves AIDS infected addicts who carry the TB bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with to health care workers and other people
The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance wrote Dr. Peter A
While most people with the AIDS virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life long risk of getting TB
