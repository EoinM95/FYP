Title:  THIRD WORLD S MASSIVE DEBT GROWING WORSE WORLD BANK REPORT SAYS ECONOMIC GROWTH MIXED 
 Third World debtors had to pay 50.1 billion more to service their debts to the United States and other creditors last year than they received in new loans a major drain on their already cash strapped economies the World Bank reported Sunday
The figure contained in the bank s annual report and made public before its annual meeting here Sept. 23 was almost a third larger than in 1987 when the net pay back totaled 38.3 billion
The bank also reported that despite the relatively buoyant economic growth in most industrial countries developing countries turned in a decidedly mixed performance ranging from a mini boom in Southeast Asian economies to further impoverishment in Africa
The bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to Third World countries to about 16.4 billion in the current fiscal year up from 14.8 billion in fiscal 1988
The figures on the cash drain showed that these net resource transfers as the bank parlance terms them are mushrooming rapidly a measure of the mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on Third World economies
A bank spokesman said that part of the reason that the figure is so bloated is that some countries such as cash rich South Korea are paying off their debts early
