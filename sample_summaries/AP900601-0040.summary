Title: Hurricane Center Director Warns of New Era of Destructive Storms
 The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East and Gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new era of destructive storms
The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by a tropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavy rain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into a hurricane
Many coastal communities with swelling populations are ill prepared to handle a hurricane emergency said Robert Sheets director of the National Hurricane Center
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report predicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine to Texas will grow 60 percent counting from 1960 until 2010
The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last year taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine to Texas Sheets said
If the long term trends are any indication of what s to come we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes said Sheets
Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity are based on studies of past decades atmospheric low pressure waves and increased rainfall trends in West Africa near the breeding waters for most hurricanes
