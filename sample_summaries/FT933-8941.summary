Title:  FT 12 AUG 93 Commodities and Agriculture Investors sought for Zimbabwe diamond mine 
 INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe which De Beers the South African group that dominates the diamond business discovered but then let get away
De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and importantly given the heat generated by the politics of the region across the border in South Africa
After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production as Venetia one of the world s biggest diamond mines
The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds
Mr Robin Baxter Brown chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines one of the new joint owners of River Ranch said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving
Also all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines
Mr Baxter Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience
The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds and since mining started in March last year it has produced 43 000 carats of diamonds 60 per cent of them of gem quality Mr Baxter Brown said
