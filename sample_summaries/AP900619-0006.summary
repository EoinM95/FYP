Title: Midwest Sees 1990 Tornado Parade
 1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation
So far this year 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six months of last year and the 30 year average of 482 tornadoes recorded between January and July said Frederick Ostby of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center here
The nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 one of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950 when the forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms
There were 756 tornadoes reported in 1982
The culprit in this tornado barrage across the Plains is a persistent West Coast pattern of low pressure in the upper atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern latitude
This year s storms seem particularly violent as illustrated by the March 13 tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds of 300 mph to a field in Kansas
The tornado was the strongest to hit the United States since 1985
However a study of tornado trends indicates parts of the Midwest particularly Kansas and Missouri are heading into a six year period of more intense tornadoes
The study of tornadoes since early this century shows that they are concentrated in regions for five or six year periods said Michael Smith president of WeatherData Inc
