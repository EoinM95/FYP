Title:  ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS COUNTYWIDE PLAN WOULD COUNT ILLEGALS IN 90 CENSUS 
 The director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County residents including illegal aliens to be counted in the 1990 Census and he will ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position
Agency officials said that if illegal aliens were to be excluded from the count it would mean that on paper the county had 200 000 fewer residents than the county s actual population
In a letter to the supervisors Larry Leaman director of the agency urged the board to adopt the resolution supporting a complete count of all county residents and opposing all attempts to systematically exclude any groups from the census
