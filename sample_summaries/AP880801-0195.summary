Title: Setting Fires An Ozark Tradition for Some Investigator Says
 A split charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire
And there are other ways to tell a fire was accidental
You eliminate all those causes you re down to arson said Dale Smallwood a criminal investigator for Missouri s Mark Twain National Forest
He comes down to arson in most of his investigations and he and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames
Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year burning more than 9 000 acres Smallwood said
A total of 14 200 acres of the forest which covers 1.5 million acres mostly in southern Missouri were burned during a spring fire season made more volatile by drought
On average Smallwood estimates 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set
It s just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary deliberately set fires McDonald said
As one of the Forest Service s 125 special law enforcement agents Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves
Aesthetics even played a part Shea and other researchers found that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the smell of smoke in the spring air and believed the woods looked better burned clean
