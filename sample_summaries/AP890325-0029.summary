Title: Chemicals Fail To Break Up Largest Spill In US History
 The calm waters of Prince William Sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in US history which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice officials said
The spill of some 270 000 barrels or 11.3 million gallons occurred early Friday when the 987 foot tanker Exxon Valdez went hard aground on Bligh Reef about 25 miles outside Valdez the northermost ice free port in the United States
Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil
This is the largest oil spill in US history and it unfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous islands channels bays and fiords said Richard Golob publisher of the Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin
A spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to be a cleanup nightmare said Golob a Cambridge Mass. based consultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental disasters for 15 years
