Title: Proposed Moratorium On Let It Burn Policy Likely To End By May
 A recommended halt to the government s let it burn forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring according to the co chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium
The panel in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn
The panel suggested a temporary halt to the let it burn policy saying the Forest Service and the National Park Service needed more time to refine their fire management plans
My guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of the Western fire season which is the middle of May Charles Philpot co chairman of the review panel told a news conference
