Title:  GANDHI S SLAYING IGNITES TURMOIL MILITARY PLACED ON RED ALERT 
 India s military and paramilitary forces were put on red alert as gangs took to the streets of New Delhi and other cities looking for scapegoats
A Congress Party spokesman said the bomb was hidden in a bouquet of flowers offered to Gandhi as he approached the dais for his speech
There was no immediate indication who was responsible for the bomb but speculation centered on Tamil separatists seeking an independent state in nearby Sri Lanka
Analysts here said there is no obvious successor to him as leader of the Congress Party which was founded by his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru India s first prime minister and later dominated by his mother Indira Gandhi who was prime minister when she was assassinated in 1984
His widow Sonia sobbed and hugged the couple s daughter Priyanka as the women stepped down from the air force Boeing 737 that had flown them to Madras to bring Gandhi s body home
Even before Gandhi s death more than 150 people had died this week in violence connected to the election
Government officials in New Delhi ordered all government offices schools and colleges shut amid widespread fears that the assassination would touch off a wave of violence in a country that has endured a spate of riots during the past year mainly over religious and caste conflicts
Guerrillas suspected Most of the early speculation however focused on Gandhi s most hardened opponents in Tamil Nadu the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam a disciplined and violent guerrilla force that has used Tamil Nadu as a base in its campaign to win a separate state in Sri Lanka the island nation just off India s southeastern coast
During the current election the Congress Party faced a brisk challenge from a leftist coalition led by former Prime Minister VP Singh who denounced what he called Congress s culture of corruption and advocated divisive job set asides for India s lower castes and religious minorities
An even tougher test for the Congress and the centrist ideology that has held India together for four decades has been mounted by Hindu ultranationalists from the Bharatiya Janata Party who denounced Gandhi for allegedly pandering to India s Muslim minority and directing too many government resources to religious and caste minorities in an effort to win votes
Election in India turmoil and tragedy The Congress Party which has dominated Indian politics since independence in 1947 is being challenged by a center left coalition that wants to break down the caste system and a right wing party that seeks a more openly Hindu less secular India
