Title:  JOE MORGAN S SUIT PROTESTS DRUG PROFILE CIVIL RIGHTS THE FORMER BASEBALL STAR SAYS HE WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED BY POLICE AND ARRESTED AT LAX BECAUSE HE IS BLACK. A SECOND TRIAL ON HIS CLAIM IS SET. 
 As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby
When Searle noticed a short muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him
Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that March day in 1988 was Joe Morgan the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted Monday into Major League baseball s Hall of Fame
The 46 year old Morgan who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain profile that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like
There s no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by said William Barnes one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer
The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports
It s purely based on race or dress not on whether you are involved in any drug activity said Gary Trichter a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases
