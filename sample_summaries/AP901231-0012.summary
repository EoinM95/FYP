Title: Mexico Gets Ready Early For Total Solar Eclipse
 Mexico where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers is gearing up early for the day next year when the sun will be blotted out
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as the slar eclipse of the century on July 11
Posters have been placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event and resorts along the eclipse s path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists
It s the most important eclipse in history says Miguel Gil Guzman secretary general of the Mexican Astronomical Society
This one will cut a swath across one of the most populous regions of the globe turning day to night for an estimated 50 million residents in 14 of Mexico s 31 states
The eclipse path reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil
On July 11 the moon will pass between the planet and the sun abruptly swallowing midday s light except for a weird glow on the horizon
The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California Sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of 300 cloudless days a year
