Title:  British Government Says It Won t Help Fund High Speed Rail Link to Chunnel 
 Sarah Talbot Williams a spokeswoman for the Confederation of British Industry Britain s main employers group says 1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market
If we don t have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe we ll continue our status as an island
And although the project s estimated cost has soared to #7.66 billion 13.11 billion from #4.9 billion tunnel executives have obtained underwriting for an equity rights offer and preliminary agreement for more bank loans to cover the added cost
But the lack of a high speed rail link to London and improved service beyond means Britain may miss out on the tunnel s total benefits
There is a danger of not being able to exploit the tunnel to its full potential says Prof. Christopher Nash a transport expert at Leeds University in Northern England
The government s refusal to help fund a fast rail service between London and the tunnel terminal at Folkestone culminates an 18 month squabble
European Rail Link Ltd. a consortium formed last November to build the rail link had asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the total #2.6 billion cost of the link
He said British Rail which owns 50 of the consortium would consider other options for a fast rail link
Defending the decision Mrs. Thatcher earlier told Parliament that the government already had earmarked almost #2 billion for chunnel related projects including #600 million on roads leading to the tunnel and #1.3 billion in passenger and freight rail services
The traffic will now speed through as far as our side of the tunnel and then the men with red flags will lead it on to London complains Keith Speed a Conservative member of Parliament whose constituency is near the tunnel terminal
The tunnel building consortium argues that only 39 of its total revenue will come from direct London to Paris trains the real money spinner will be freight traffic hauled by road to the tunnel then loaded onto special Eurotunnel wagons for the journey under the channel
