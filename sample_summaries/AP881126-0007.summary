Title: Hormone Found in Diabetics May Play Role in Disease Researcher Says
 Further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease a scientist says
We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be if not the final cause at least a major part of the disease process said New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper
The research opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that wasn t possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging he said
Cooper who has been working with scientists at Oxford University described the hormone research this week at the 13th International Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney Australia
In his presentation Cooper said the hormone dubbed amylin was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics
