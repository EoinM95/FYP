Title: Gilbert Third Force 5 Hurricane This Century
 With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour US weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere
Mark Zimmer a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert s center at 26.13 inches at 5 52 pm EDT on Tuesday
The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph killing 408 people he said
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane s center Gilbert also was one of the largest
But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course no records are kept on their overall size said center meterologist Jesse Moore
Hurricane Debby which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month was probably about half that size Moore said
The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28 foot wave in 1969 leaving 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead
