Title:  JET CARRYING 293 CRASHES BURNS IN IOWA 166 SURVIVE 
 A crippled United Airlines DC 10 crashed a half mile short of a runway while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon bursting into a cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as 15 000 pieces and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on board
Remarkably as many as 166 persons survived the violent crash according to Richard Vohs a spokesman for Iowa Gov
Tail Engine Explodes The plane s tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately clear how the explosion contributed to what a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman called complete hydraulic failure an occurrence regarded as extremely rare in the wide bodied DC 10 which has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all the plane s control surfaces on its wings and tail and landing gear and brakes
As rescuers worked underneath floodlights to remove bodies from the crash site original estimates of the death toll one as high as 190 which would have made the crash the second worst in US history were reduced
The survivors of Wednesday s United Flight 232 from Denver to Philadelphia via Chicago included several dozen passengers who managed to walk out of a dark smoke filled upside down section of the jet after it broke off and came to rest in a tall cornfield off the runway
Suitcases paper mail clothes chunks of burning metal and bodies were strewn over the inactive runway at Sioux Gateway Airport where the plane crashed after desperately circling for a half hour
Eyewitnesses said pieces of the 15 year old airplane one of the oldest airliners in United s fleet were falling off as far as 75 miles from the site of the crash
By forcing liquid through a tube the system provides enough power for a pilot to move an airliner s huge tail rudder and elevators and wing panels known as flaps and ailerons all needed to steer an aircraft
Some aviation experts speculating on why Flight 232 crashed after completing less than half of its scheduled 930 mile trip to Chicago suggested that the explosion of the tail engine sent shards of metal through the tail section somehow destroying common lines that serve the three hydraulic systems
At one point Haynes attempted a landing on Highway 20 near Cushing Iowa but chose not to touch down there in favor of trying to make Sioux City a farming and livestock center of 82 000 in the northwest corner of Iowa along the Missouri River
Haynes brought the plane into the airport s 9 000 foot long southwest runway surrounded by corn soybeans and pasture with some trees seven miles outside downtown Sioux City
