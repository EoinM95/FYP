Title:  FT 17 AUG 93 Technology An outbreak of conflicting opinions Despite assurances that BSE is waning there is new concern about the epidemic 
 The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease which has killed more than 100 000 animals in the UK is causing a new wave of public concern
New cases are still running at almost 1 000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld Jacob Disease a brain disorder similar to BSE
Richard Lacey a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance
The advisers led by the government s chief medical officer Kenneth Calman and chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month s death of 65 year old Duncan Templeman following that of Peter Warhurst 61 a year ago showed no features that give cause for undue concern 
Robert Will of Edinburgh s Western General Hospital who has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health department calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE affected herds
