Title:  THE NRA FIGHTS BACK ON THE DEFENSIVE OVER ASSAULT WEAPONS THE GUN LOBBY IS USING CONTROVERSIAL TACTICS TO TARGET ITS ENEMIES 
Inside customers took time out from browsing through AK 47 assault rifles and a flock of other firearms to sign a petition and to vent their wrath at a local turncoat US Sen
We are petitioning to protest the semiautomatic gun control bills before Congress read the text above a fast growing list of names
If we allow the government to become involved in any type of gun control we are violating a basic constitutional right the right to keep and bear arms
The petitioners target that sunny day last spring was DeConcini a longtime opponent of gun control measures who had suddenly switched sides sponsoring one of the nine bills currently in Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons
I m a one issue voter and I m going to do everything in my power to take DeConcini out George Hiers a burly man on crutches vowed as he bought a semiautomatic shotgun for his wife to defend herself with while he s away on hunting trips
The attack on DeConcini was stirred up by the National Rifle Assn. in a display of fury that represented far more than retaliation against a former supporter
Long described as the powerful gun lobby the NRA is now scrambling to recover from stunning setbacks in the past three years
Over the NRA s opposition Congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning cop killer bullets that penetrate protective vests plastic guns that can be slipped past metal detectors and Saturday night specials that are used in many crimes
And most recently the group found itself caught in the furor over assault weapons that was ignited by the massacre of five children in a Stockton schoolyard last January
Those killings combined with the increasing use of the weapons by drug dealers and youth gangs have exacerbated the contentious relations between the NRA and its former allies
Law enforcement leaders concerned about rising violence and terrorism have ended their friendliness toward the gun lobby and become well organized in opposition
Politicians once fearful of the NRA have been much more willing to stand up to it President Bush an NRA Life Member on July 7 imposed a permanent ban on imports of assault rifles and has proposed limiting the semiautomatics ammunition clips
The ban so infuriated some NRA members that they have launched petition drives in two dozen states to oust Bush from the organization
Meanwhile California whose voters only seven years ago defeated an initiative that would have frozen the number of handguns in the state last May became the first state to ban assault weapons
At the same time gun control organizations are beginning to match the NRA s mass mailings ads and lobbying many schools are showing Guns and the Constitution an anti gun video produced by Handgun Control Inc. whose chairwoman is Sarah Brady wife of former White House Press Secretary James Brady who was disabled by gunfire in the 1981 assassination attempt on then President Reagan
Thus in fending off the assaults on assault weapons the 118 year old NRA is facing what its leaders call its most daunting challenge
We re at a crossroads James Jay Baker the NRA s top congressional lobbyist acknowledged as DeConcini s assault weapons bill cleared its first Senate hurdle in April
Aside from the nation s capital two of the hottest battlegrounds in the assault weapons fight are Arizona and Florida
But with opinion polls in both states showing that large majorities of residents support bans and with police complaining about being outgunned by criminals legislators have moved into action spurring angry counterattacks from the NRA
Orasin president of 15 year old Handgun Control the NRA s chief nemesis estimates that as many as 500 000 members of the NRA and other gun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats
DeConcini s bill calls for a nationwide ban on sales of AK 47s and eight other semiautomatic rifles guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and much of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military and police
In his letter Baker called DeConcini s proposal a tragic mistake charging that it could even block sales of traditional hunting rifles and lead to criminal charges against 30 million sportsmen who own semiautomatic guns
It concluded with a call to arms warning that DeConcini needs to know we will not allow our constitutional freedoms to be strangled by restrictions that have absolutely no effect on the criminals who are supposed to be the real target. . . 
In three weeks DeConcini s office received 6 395 calls and letters against his bill and 68 for it despite a poll indicating that more than two thirds of the people in metropolitan Phoenix favor some kind of ban on assault weapons
Martin Mandall a brash Scottsdale gun dealer who insisted that a reporter feel the thrill of firing Uzi and AK 47 machine guns at a range in his store basement vowed during a conversation there to work with the utmost severity to get DeConcini out of office
Interviewed in his Phoenix office as the firestorm was building a serene DeConcini accused the NRA of lies and exaggerations about his bill he strongly disputed the NRA s claim that a provision banning any gun nearly identical to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover virtually all semiautomatics
A subcommittee was getting ready to vote on a bill that would ban a list of semiautomatic assault weapons and Hammer had asked to speak against it
