Title: Workers Try To Unload Tanker Environmentalists Call Spill a Disaster
 Millions of gallons of crude oil that spilled when a tanker ran aground spread across a wildlife rich stretch of ocean Saturday and Alaska s chief environmental officer criticized cleanup efforts as too slow
The biggest oil spill in US history created a slick about seven miles long and seven miles wide in Prince William Sound
This situation I think was everyone s secret nightmare about what could happen with oil traffic in the sound said Dennis Kelso commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
Some 240 000 barrels about 10 080 000 gallons of crude oil from Alaska s North Slope spilled early Friday when the 987 foot tanker Exxon Valdez ran hard aground on Bligh Reef about 25 miles outside Valdez where it had taken on a total cargo of 1.2 million barrels
What we have here is a major environmental catastrophe said one oil spill expert Richard Golob of Boston publisher of Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin
Golob said cleanup equipment at the site was grossly inadequate but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup efforts would not have significantly reduced the spill s impact
Efforts to begin pumping 200 000 gallons of oil off the Exxon Valdez onto another tanker the Exxon Baton Rouge were halted early Saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to leaking as the pumping operation proceeded
Eleven of 17 tanks that lie forward of the ship s masthead were ruptured in the accident causing concern over removal of the oil said Coast Guard Lt
He also said four members of the Coast Guard s Pacific Strike Team from San Francisco specially trained to deal with pollution and oil spills arrived Saturday and were helping to rig pumps and assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the Baton Rouge
