Title:  4 WHO CLAIM POLICE BEAT THEM WERE NOT CHARGED OXNARD THE PUBLIC DEFENDER S OFFICE SAYS IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY S OFFICE NOT TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF CRIMES BY POLICE. 
 Over the past two years the Ventura County district attorney s office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by Oxnard officers records show
In a fifth and more recent incident the district attorney s office declined to file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police
The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city the department or the police officers involved
Edward Brodie misdemeanor supervisor for the office said the decisions not to prosecute the suspects do not necessarily mean that Oxnard police were not justified in making the arrests
In each of the four cases Brodie said his office did not prosecute because it found that police did not provide enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt
But Jean Farley a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender s office said it is extremely rare for the district attorney s office not to prosecute a suspect who is accused by police
The district attorney s office may have declined to prosecute the suspects because police brutality has been alleged she said
He said however that the decisions by the district attorney s office not to prosecute the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department
The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from the June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in the 1300 block of South E Street
Police had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of resisting arrest but the district attorney s office decided two weeks later to prosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest
According to a police report filed by Officer Michael Cole police were sent to a parking lot outside the Oxnard Moose Lodge to investigate a report of an altercation between several men after a wedding reception
But the district attorney s office declined to file any charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in the altercation Brodie said
