Title:  Politics Policy @ Problems Loom for Census as Congress Debates @ Whether Illegal Immigrants Are US Persons @ 
 Though the forms for the 1990 census are already at the printers Congress is contemplating adding a question Are you an illegal immigrant
The Census Bureau as it has in the past is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status
But the Senate already has voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment
It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced Rep
It boils down to regional politics says Arturo Vargas census program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants
Their opponents say the drafters of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment never even considered the concept of an illegal immigrant let alone contemplated their current numbers. @ Estimates of Illegal Aliens @ Counted in 1980 Census @ TOTAL US 2 057 000 @ California 1 024 000 @ New York 234 000 @ Texas 186 000 @ Illinois 135 000 @ Florida 80 000 @ Source Census Bureau
