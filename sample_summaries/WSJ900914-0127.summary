Title:  Technology Medicine Rise in Hurricanes Off US East Coast Is Forecast Using Study of African Rain 
 Based on the new findings Mr. Gray predicted earlier this summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average and so far he seems to be right
In July he said there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named of which six would be hurricanes
The National Hurricane Center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year including four hurricanes a higher rate than normal
Weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane patterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal residents of the US and the Caribbean
A sharp decrease in hurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business and residential development that would be vulnerable to increased hurricane activity
Mr. Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity
Mr. Gray said his research published in the current issue of Science suggests that intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change
