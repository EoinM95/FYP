Title:  LANDSCAPING CAN BE 1ST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST WILDFIRE GARDENING 
While little can be done to control the natural fires that occur in chaparral country homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve the chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire
The idea behind fire resistant landscaping firescaping is to design landscaping to minimize the fire hazard says Owen Dell a Santa Barbara landscape contractor who has many canyon and hillside homeowners as clients
Dell became interested in the concept after the 1977 Sycamore Canyon fire in which 200 homes were lost and only a shift in the wind prevented the loss of additional Santa Barbara residences
Dell the Santa Barbara City Fire Department the city government and a number of volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the Santa Barbara Firescapes Demonstration Garden to educate the public about reducing the risks of wildfire near their homes
