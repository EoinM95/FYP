Title:  WHY IT COULD HAPPEN HERE CONDITIONS IN SOUTH BAY HILLS MIRROR DEADLY MIX 
 Now in the wake of that firestorm local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether but only when and where
I know it s there said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule
Every fire chief there s 12 of us in this county knows it s there
The danger is in the Saratoga foothills where Kraule s department has battled nine deliberately set fires since June most recently Oct. 19 the same day Oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm
It s in the mountain communities that straddle Highway 9 in Santa Cruz County isolated by weak bridges that won t support some firetrucks and connected by a two lane road that will hinder escape
It s in Los Altos Hills where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire retardant roofs a year later a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes many of which have been rebuilt with the same flammable shake roofs
In fact the danger of an Oakland like inferno is in almost all of the hills that ring the South Bay where homes often are surrounded by dense brush or stately trees the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires
And the risk is increasing as cramped Bay Area residents push farther into the hills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere
The tendency is to have bigger fires that are much more expensive to put out with much more property loss said Roy Pike a deputy chief in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection s Santa Rosa office
Privacy s high price Having pushed into these areas city dwellers don t understand that the wooded seclusion and natural beauty exact a cost in fire protection rescue workers complain
Those are the risks you take when you live in an area like this said Dean Lucke chief of the forestry department s San Mateo Santa Cruz ranger unit
In general firefighters say the heavily wooded Santa Cruz Mountains are more susceptible to major fires than the grass covered eastern foothills
A large concentration of vegetation heavy fuel loads lots of wooden structures ingress egress problems lack of water they re all there said Fremont Fire Chief Dan Lydon whose department would be one of the first called to a fire in Kilkare
Challenge for firefighters Many of the South Bay s most vulnerable areas such as Redwood Estates above Los Gatos and Emerald Lake Hills above Redwood City began as colonies of summer homes a handful of secluded cottages strung along narrow winding roads
