Title:  Bank of Boston s Loan Write Off Plan Is Expected to Have Wide Repercussions By Peter Truell Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
 Bank of Boston Corp. s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions bankers and analysts say
Domestically the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York Chicago and San Francisco
Internationally it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans
On one hand there is a small group of money center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries
On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which with relatively small exposure to developing countries are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or as Bank of Boston decided Monday to completely write off some loans as uncollectible
It s a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out says Lawrence Cohn an analyst at Merrill Lynch Co
The Bank of Boston decision may well drive a wedge between the money center banks and the regional banks adds James J
It s created an enormous quandary for many money center banks Mr. McDermott says
Actions such as that taken by Bank of Boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money center banks
Management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks
The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities bank analysts said
While the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations
Earlier this year Bank of Boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a 6 billion bank loan for Mexico according to New York bankers
Now that Bank of Boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less developed countries it s likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts
Moreover most of the nation s big banks couldn t afford to follow Bank of Boston s lead without crippling their capital and reducing their common equity asset ratios to unacceptably low levels
For instance if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston s action it would have to add 3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69 Keefe Bruyette estimates
In order to take steps similar to Bank of Boston s large money center banks would have to sell assets shrink balance sheets and slash dividends and they show little sign of doing that
