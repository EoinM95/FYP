Title: Maine Judge Finds Felon Retains Gun Rights Under State Constitution
 A 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns a judge ruled
Prosecutors had argued that the amendment s backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent
If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions Perkins wrote
Maine s right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state amendments he wrote
