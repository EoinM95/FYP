Title: Exxon Submits Strategy on Alaska Cleanup Plan
 Exxon officials Monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation s largest oil spill but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws
The plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond mid September and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline may not be cleaned mechanically at all but be allowed to be washed naturally by the environment
Since March 24 when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside Valdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude into Prince William Sound Exxon has financed cleanup crews fighting the spreading sludge
The oil company s strategy which was submitted to state and federal authorities only hours before a deadline expired divides Alaska s oil tainted shores into four categories from the most heavily polluted to those that are only lightly oiled
It covers polluted areas within Prince William Sound as well as those outside the immediate spill zone and calls for nearly 3 400 workers to participate in the cleanup
