Title: Office of Fair Trading To Investigate Complaint Against De Beers
 The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti competitive practices by a London based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa s giant De Beers diamond organization
The watchdog body said De Beers appeared to have a monopoly on diamond trading in London and it was interested in establishing whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC a British mining concern with no diamond interests acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg based Minorco SA
The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London De Beers is a South African company
