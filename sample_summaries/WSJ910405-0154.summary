Title:  Police Chiefs Must Denounce Gates 
 A police chief plays an essential role in setting the climate in which his department operates
Through the years Mr. Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime
A few years ago Chief Gates referred to gang members as dirty little cowards and warned them that there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer
The exchange sounded more like one gang challenging another than a police chief seeking to reduce conflict in the community
Mr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals
