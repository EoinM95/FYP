Title: Trout Rescued From Ash Tainted Creek Fires Fought in Six States
 Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long handled nets
Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in southwestern New Mexico put in containers on mules and horses loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery
Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning caused Divide fire which started June 30 and burned about 10 000 acres 150 miles southwest of Albuquerque said Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea Garcia
Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2 000 acre Livermore Fire west of Fort Collins Colo. in Roosevelt National Forest the last of three major fires in Colorado to be encircled by firefighters
Earlier firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which covered 2 000 acres in Boulder Canyon and destroyed dozens of homes and halted a 2 600 acre fire in Mesa Verde National Monument in southwestern Colorado
