Title: Oldest Known Record of Total Eclipse Is Younger Than Thought Study Says
 Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers researchers said today
Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria occurred on May 3 1375 BC But in today s issue of the British journal Nature two Dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later on March 5 1223 BC The tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of Ugarit an ancient city near Syria s Mediterranean coast
Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse Edwin Krupp director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles said in a telephone interview
