Title:  ATTORNEY SAYS IMPLICATING LEWIS UNFAIR 
 Carl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance enhancing drugs just after their 100 meter final last fall at the Seoul Olympics
He got out of those blocks like a caged lion Lewis said in an interview Sunday at the Los Angeles Marathon where he was representing a sponsor
I said Look I don t know what he is taking or what he is doing but he is doing something
Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson s drug test which returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol
At a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport Monday at Toronto Charlie Francis a Canadian sprint coach testified that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer before a urinalysis
Francis based his theory on the fact that Johnson took the steroid furazabol three weeks before the Games not the difficult to detect stanozolol
According to Francis testimony Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples
Francis said that two witnesses told him that the stranger had spoken with Lewis in another area of the waiting room
Lewis had finished second to Johnson who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100 meter gold medal and subsequently also had to be tested
Any allocation or innuendo that Carl Lewis tampered with Ben Johnson s drink or sample is ludicrous said David Greifinger Lewis attorney
These sound like the last acts of desperate men who know they ve committed wrong and see no other way out other than to continue to lie and to fabricate stories
Charlie and Ben should own up to the fact that what they did was wrong and should promise to never to do it again and move on with their lives
Lewis said Sunday that officials of the International Amateur Athletics Federation should disallow Johnson s world record from Rome because Francis has testified his sprinter took drugs before the World Championships
If it has been proven that he took drugs I would think that withdrawing the record is the responsible thing for the sport Lewis said Sunday
