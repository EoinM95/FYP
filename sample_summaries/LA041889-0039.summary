Title:  ETHIOPIAN WALTZES THROUGH BOSTON MEKONNEN WINS IN 2 09 06 KRISTIANSEN FIRST IN 2 24 33 
 Out of the horn of Africa has emerged the most devastating and dominant group of marathon runners the world has seen
Or at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation and won three consecutive Olympic gold medals putting its indelible stamp on the marathon
It appears to be happening again a generation after Abebe Bikila ran barefoot through the darkened streets of Rome in 1960 to win the first of his two Olympic golds
Now it is Abebe Mekonnen who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic Marathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero
Mekonnen a police lieutenant from Addis Ababa made a furious rush with a mile to go passing Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania and winning Monday s Boston Marathon in 2 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds
With temperatures in the high 60s during the Patriot s Day race it was about 20 degrees warmer than it was Sunday and all of last week
Joan Benoit Samuelson who set a world record on this course in 1983 was beset with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles and she finished ninth among the women in 2 37 52
In an emotional news conference afterward Samuelson who won the first women s Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles tearfully conceded that she might have run her last marathon for some time
But the story of Monday s 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 million which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon running
Also on Sunday in the World Cup Marathon at Milan Ethiopians finished 1 2
Keleke Metaferia won in 2 10 28 and Dereje Nedi was second in 2 10 36
Two other Ethiopians were in Monday s Boston race placing ninth and 18th
Much of the central part of the country is mountainous ranging in altitude from 6 000 to 15 000 feet
It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and Mekonnen 24 made the most of it
