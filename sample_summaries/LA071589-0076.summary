Title:  BID TO EXCLUDE ILLEGALS FROM CENSUS HIT OFFICIALS SAY MOVE WOULD HURT STATE IN CONGRESS CUT FEDERAL AID 
 Public officials throughout California have condemned a US Senate vote Thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census saying the action will shortchange California in Congress and possibly deprive the state of millions of dollars of federal aid for medical emergency services and other programs for poor people
Major Impact If it becomes law the Senate s action could have a major impact on California and other states where the influx of illegal aliens significantly boosts the population and thus can affect the size of congressional delegations and the amount of federal aid that is doled out
But if illegal aliens are not counted the experts say the state would not get one of the anticipated seats
Huff the state s financial director said the state could lose as much as 300 million in federal aid that is allocated on the basis of population as determined by census counts
