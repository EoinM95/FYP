Title: Lawmakers Debate Counting Illegal Aliens
 Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens
The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would require the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in the country legally and if not to delete them from the counts used in reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives
