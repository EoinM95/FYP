Title: City Image Tarnished By Allegations Of Police Racism
 Allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial harmony
The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside review of the department
The city s police chief John Laux says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society
