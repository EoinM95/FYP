Title:  THOMAS SPOUSE ALSO IN SPOTLIGHT CRITICS SAY HER VIEWS COULD INFLUENCE CASES 
 Her critics see her as more than the supportive spouse who ll accompany her husband Clarence through his Senate confirmation hearings which began Tuesday and are likely to run through next week
They see a woman with strong opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court
Some religious rights groups are troubled by her anti cult activities in light of her former involvement with Lifespring a motivational group
The fact that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots
In their respective careers the Thomases have embraced the view that women and minorities are hindered rather than helped by affirmative action and government programs
I don t think it s fair to say she s anti women s rights said Ricky Silberman vice chairwoman of the EEOC and a friend of the Thomases
