Title: Western Fires No Threat Yet To Last Year s Record
 This week s flare up of Western wildfires can t hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year s record breaking fire season but officials say a dry August could change everything
Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since January in the contiguous United States compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year fire officials said Monday
Right now the fire season is just starting to gear up said Sandi Sacher spokeswoman at the federal government s wildfire command post in Boise Idaho
Nearly 10 000 firefighters in five Western states are battling hundreds of blazes most of them sparked last week by lightning
By year s end 6 million acres had burned in the West and Alaska making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years and in terms of firefighting resources committed the most expensive in US history Sacher said
