Title:  Term Limits Are Constitutional 
 State statutes that bar first time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated
But state statutes that simply limit the tenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yet been tested in court
The constitutionality of such state term limits may however be tested next month
Florida s attorney general has asked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on a term limit initiative that would limit the state s members of Congress to eight consecutive years in office
By 6 to 1 the California Supreme Court ruled this month that the state s new term limit law was constitutional
