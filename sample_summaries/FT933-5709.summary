Title:  FT 02 SEP 93 World Trade News Chicago back room operator to sell Nafta Laurie Morse on a Daley drafted in to lead ratification drive 
 THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get his free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in international trade arenas
But he comes to Washington well prepared for the kind of back room political arm twisting that will be required to persuade a divided Congress to pass it
William Daley is younger brother and chief adviser to Chicago s mayor Richard M Daley and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine Boss the late Richard J Daley
Unlike his hot tempered and very public brother 45 year old Bill Daley is a smooth talking behind the scenes operator with important connections in Washington and long standing ties with organised labour
Mr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton s chief negotiator at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva
He chaired Mr Clinton s election campaign in Illinois where he delivered 48 per cent of the vote to Clinton above the national average and continues as a tangible supporter
However Mr Daley s appointment to chair the White House s task force on the North America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff
Mr Clinton himself reserved his support for the deal negotiated under George Bush s administration until side agreements dealing with environmental and labour issues were reached last month
Mr Daley was chosen for the job Chicago observers say because he has proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a controversial battle
Clinton needs someone with political sense to move this thing through Congress and Daley has the connections says a fellow Washington lobbyist
By rough count Mr Daley will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement those along the border with Mexico and those with big agricultural consumer product or manufacturing export interests
