Title:  HL REVIEW OUTLOOK Editorial Welfare s Trojan Horse
 How much more of an investment should American taxpayers make in the welfare system
This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987
The bill proposes 5.2 billion in new spending over five years and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients
It appears that what we have here is something of a Trojan horse a piece of legislation that is represented as reform when all it does is expand existing welfare programs
