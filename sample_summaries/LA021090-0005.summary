Title:  GUN NUTS HAVE A REAL POINT CONSTITUTION THE CLIMATE MAY NOW BE RUNNING IN FAVOR OF MORE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDING A BAN ON HANDGUNS. BUT THERE S STILL THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 
A Time Magazine Cable News Network poll reports that 87 of gun owners themselves favor a seven day waiting period for handgun purchases three quarters favor registration of semi automatic weapons and handguns and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns
Unfortunately there is the Second Amendment to the Constitution A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
Since the amendment s stated purpose is arming state militias they reason it creates no individual right to own a gun
But why leap to the conclusion that a broadly worded constitutional freedom the right of the people to keep and bear arms is narrowly limited by its stated purpose unless you re trying to explain it away
A colleague says that if liberals interpreted the Second Amendment the way they interpret the rest of the Bill of Rights there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory
Kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the Second Amendment like other Bill of Rights protections was intended to incorporate English common law rights of the time which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia
