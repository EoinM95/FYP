Title: Accidental Shooting Another Blow to Police Force
 The accidental shooting death of a young stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike against a police force already struggling with allegations of brutality and racism
Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3 30 am and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong
It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year
Barnes was white as is the officer who shot him however other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens
