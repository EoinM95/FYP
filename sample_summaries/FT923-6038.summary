Title:  FT 27 AUG 92 Hurricane batters southern US but lets insurers off lightly 
 HURRICANE Andrew claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low lying city of New Orleans
The storm which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north west across the Gulf of Mexico had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country
Although the damage from the hurricane s landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated insurers losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn well below earlier expectations a senior member of Lloyd s insurance market said yesterday
