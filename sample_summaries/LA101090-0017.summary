Title:  PERSPECTIVE ON TERM LIMITATIONS THE CONSEQUENCES OF TINKERING VOTERS MAY FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS AKIN TO BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE JUST TO GET RIDOF THE RATS. 
 There is a recurring temptation in American politics to wreak vengeance on one s adversaries by overhauling the political institutions that they dominate
Roosevelt s plan to expand the Supreme Court in 1937 to dilute the votes of conservatives resulted in the creation of an opposing political coalition that lived on after the controversy to plague every subsequent Democratic President
The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would never be another FDR so they pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms
By itself the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend setter but similar measures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado
Eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year some journalists have seen in the Oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents a manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the Democrats the party that holds the largest number of legislative seats
It is Republicans naturally enough who seem to be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation since they have the most to gain at least in the short term from an indiscriminate clean out of the nation s deliberative bodies
