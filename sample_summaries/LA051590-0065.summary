Title:  WORST FIRE SEASON IN DECADES SEEN 
 Prolonged drought bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing brush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades fire officials warned Monday
A map released Monday by the Los Angeles County Fire Department showed that some of the most vulnerable fire zones can be found this summer in chaparral covered foothill and mountain canyon slopes beside densely developed residential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs
The map was released as the state Department of Forestry officially opened the region s 1990 fire season which means its firefighting crews have been placed on higher alert and various fire prevention regulations are now in effect
While the fire season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than usual in the vulnerable foothills it was a full two months ahead of schedule in the heavily wooded mountain terrain of Southern California s national forests
The last really good rainfall was back in 82 83 so our brush really hasn t recuperated in seven years said Gordon Rowley a fire management specialist with the US Forest Service
The rainfall season which runs from July 1 to June 30 is almost over for 1989 90 and Southern California seldom gets much measurable rain in late May and the month of June
