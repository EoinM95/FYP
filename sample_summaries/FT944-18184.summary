Title:  FT 05 OCT 94 Who next. Reformers fear the assassin in Mexico The aftermath of the killing of another PRI leader 
 If Mr Ernesto Zedillo Mexico s next president had any doubts about the difficulties of reforming Mexico s governing party and the country s corrupt judicial and legal system the assassination last week of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu the party s number two official will probably have removed them
Mr Ruiz Massieu s killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha a federal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party PRI and Mr Abraham Rubio Canales a former tourism developer with strong links to the Gulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas
This alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedillo to reform his party and the country s criminal justice system will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes
Since Mr Ruiz Massieu s assassination there has been renewed speculation that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio the ruling party s reform minded presidential candidate even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case
