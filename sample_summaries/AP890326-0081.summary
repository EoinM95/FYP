Title: Captain Should Have Been Piloting Tanker Exxon Reveals Disaster Declared
 The tanker that caused the nation s biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday
Alaska s governor meanwhile declared once pristine Prince William Sound a disaster area as the toll on the waterway s abundant wildlife began to mount
The Coast Guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles
Exxon Shipping spokesman Brian Dunphy told The Associated Press that the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez Joseph Hazelwood was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate Gregory Cousins was in command
It s Exxon s policy that in the waters that the ship was located in the captain should have been on the bridge Dunphy said
The 987 foot tanker Exxon Valdez carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude oil loaded at Valdez ran onto a reef 25 miles from the port early Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice
The only larger oil related accident in US waters was the spilling and burning of up to 10.7 million gallons of oil when two ships collided in Galveston Bay in 1979
