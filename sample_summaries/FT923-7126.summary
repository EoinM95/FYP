Title:  FT 20 AUG 92 Commodities and Agriculture Prospectors go for grand slam in diamonds The latest rush is raising doubts about De Beers cartel 
 IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented greedy rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world s most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market
In Canada s Northwest Territories the discovery of 81 small diamonds some of gem quality has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the history of the North American industry
In spite of all this hectic activity it is very unlikely that anyone will find enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada s first diamond mine worthwhile
This rise of illegal mining particularly in the Cuango region which produces 80 per cent of Angola s diamonds and some of its highest quality gem stones started in May 1991 after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time in 16 years
The onset of the dry season and the fall in river levels from the end of May this year has encouraged what De Beers the South African group that dominates the world diamond business describes as a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply of illicit Angolan diamonds reaching the market 
What is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angola or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it for granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up and make all their efforts worthwhile
But the cartel has ensured that rough uncut diamond prices have risen steadily since the 1930s even when in the depths of the 1981 86 recession the price of a top quality one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail market from Dollars 60 000 to Dollars 10 000
