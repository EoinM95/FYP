Title: Shining Path Rebels Have Formed New Urban Front Garcia Says
 Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the Government Palace
Garcia spoke Wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel attacks in Lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital that resulted in the seizure of five Shining Path safe houses and 31 arrests
The president who leaves office July 28 said the newly formed People s Defense Revolutionary Movement is the urban metropolitan organ of the Shining Path
The Maoist inspired Shining Path operates in at least half of Peru especially in the mountains and jungle but has had little success in expanding to coastal cities
The Shining Path draws much of its support from indigenous peoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in the country of 22 million of descendants of European immigrants
