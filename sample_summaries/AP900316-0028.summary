Title: Nation s Tuberculosis Rate Still Falling But Very Slowly Due to AIDS
 A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS infected federal health researchers say
In 1988 the last year for which complete statistics are available 22 436 US tuberculosis cases were reported down 0.4 percent from 1987 the national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday
One reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out TB is the increasing occurrence of TB in persons infected with HIV the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome the CDC said
If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through the late 1980s an estimated 14 768 fewer TB cases would have been expected during 1985 1988 the CDC said in its weekly report
