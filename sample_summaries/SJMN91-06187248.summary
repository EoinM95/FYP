Title:  CLARENCE THOMAS TRIAL BY FIRE FROM A CRUCIBLE OF POVERTY A CONSERVATIVE IS FORMED 
 There in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past began the toughening of Clarence Thomas nominee to the United States Supreme Court
Abandoned by his father driven by his hard eyed grandfather and a band of nuns sent south to teach black children young Clarence learned sharecropping and scholarship hard labor and the Latin mass and how to survive the walk home through black Savannah in his Catholic school uniform
From these roots he might have become one of any number of bright activist black men to rise out of Southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agenda of civil rights and affirmative action as did men like Thurgood Marshall the retiring justice whose Supreme Court seat Thomas might take
Instead Thomas now 43 became something else a hybrid product of harsh Southern history and baby boom ambition a proponent of personal strength over dependence of individualism over government activism
By the time he arrived in Washington with the Reagan administration he had developed into a rare breed a black conservative so impressive to Republican presidents that he was set on the road to the highest court in the land
He would also weaken the wall separating government and religion and further restrict the rights of criminal suspects and defendants
They see him as an independent spirit a probable centrist on a court that has been steering rightward for several years
His grandfather proved to be a profound force in Thomas life a mentor a role model an unrelenting taskmaster and the embodiment of a personal philosophy that Thomas once recalled this way He used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn t solve
When Anderson wasn t coaching Thomas in his farm fields or on his delivery truck he made sure the lessons continued in the hands of the Franciscan nuns of all black St
Thomas who paid for his college education with loans jobs and the newly raised scholarship funds soon was drawn into the turbulence of Vietnam War and black power politics
Shortly after his arrival at Yale Thomas remembered when someone gave him one of Sowell s books and I threw it in the trash because it really went against all the things we d been indoctrinated to believe about the radical movement and the peace movement
