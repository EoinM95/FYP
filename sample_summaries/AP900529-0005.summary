Title: Hugo Instructive for Coastal Residents as Hurricane Season Begins
 People caught by Hurricane Hugo last year might disagree but forecasters here say the deadly storm may have had a positive side effect it got the public s attention
And one forecaster says hurricane seasons may be getting worse
But it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost anywhere else says Bob Sheets director of the National Hurricane Center
At the advent of the Atlantic hurricane season which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 Sheets and other hurricane experts are using Hugo s example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents who ve never experienced such fury
Early warnings about Hugo last September allowed 350 000 people to evacuate safely and in South Carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the Francis Marion National Forest between Charleston and Myrtle Beach Sheets said
If Hugo had struck a major coastal population center the destruction would have been greater than most Americans have ever seen according to computer simulations known as SLOSH models for Sea Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes
With SLOSH forecasters can predict the height of the storm surge the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a hurricane s most destructive component anywhere along the US coast by punching in a storm s speed size and intensity Sheets said
