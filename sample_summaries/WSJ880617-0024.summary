 The Reagan administration moved to deal with the worsening drought and a top trade official said that farm export subsidies may have to be curbed
Concern that the drought could fuel inflation drove stocks and bonds sharply lower yesterday
President Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government s Conservation Reserve Program
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the president is very concerned about the drought and wants to make certain that everything that the federal government can do to assist will be done
While he wouldn t predict what kind of disaster relief might be authorized Mr. Fitzwater said the drought certainly is going to drive up food prices
At a news briefing Special Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter warned that the administration may have to curb its so called export enhancement program if the drought becomes even worse
This program is designed to boost farm exports by reimbursing US exporters for the difference between the prices they receive for grain and other commodities in world markets and higher US prices
