Title:  EXXON RAISES VALDEZ CLEANUP COSTS TO 2 BILLION EARNINGS THE OIL GIANT WILL TAKE ANOTHER 500 MILLION CHARGE OVER THE SPILL BRINGING ITS TAB FOR THE YEAR TO 1.38 BILLION. 
 Exxon Corp. on Wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to 2 billion and said it would take another 500 million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history
In reporting its estimated 1989 earnings Exxon said it would take a 500 million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March
The charges reduced Exxon s 1989 net income to 3.8 billion compared to 5.26 billion in 1988
On Wednesday Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company s estimate of the spill s total costs so far costs to Exxon and others to about 2 billion
The fourth quarter charge comes in addition to 880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters bringing Exxon s total cleanup costs for the year to 1.38 billion
Without the cleanup charge and accounting gain Exxon said its net income for the year would have been 4.7 billion down 10.6 from 1988 despite higher oil and gas prices
