Title: Crop Production To Be Down Sharply From 1987 Food Prices Suffer
 An annual Agriculture Department survey confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall corn harvest by a third or more resulting in higher retail food prices for months and years to come
However government officials said bountiful crops in recent years has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting food
The report came hours after President Reagan signed a 3.9 billion relief bill that he acknowledged won t bring rain to crops already sweltering but hopefully will help farmers survive to plant again next spring
The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn crop will total 4.48 billion bushels down 37 percent from last year s harvest and the smallest output since 1983
Overall the department s Agricultural Statistics Board put total US crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average a scale used to compare output from year to year
That matched the low 1983 reading when sharp cutbacks in government acreage programs along with drought reduced crop production sharply
Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American farmers and as a feed ingredient is essential to the production of meat poultry and dairy products
Wilson the department s chief economist said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food this year 2 percent next year
But because of large pre season stocks total supplies are enough in most cases to assure and adequate food supply at home satisfy foreign customers and meet our food aid commitments
