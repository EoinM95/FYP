Title:  MAD COW DISEASE KILLS 10 000 CATTLE IN BRITAIN LIVESTOCK THE GOVERNMENT SEES ONLY A REMOTE RISK TO HUMANS. THE MALADY MAY BE SPREAD THROUGH CATTLE FEED. 
 Mad cow disease has killed 10 000 cattle restricted the export market for Britain s cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef
The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health but scientists still aren t certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted
Mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE was diagnosed only in 1986
The symptoms are very much like scrapie a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s
The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed which used to contain sheep by products as a protein supplement
As of Feb. 9 the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food said that 9 998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE
