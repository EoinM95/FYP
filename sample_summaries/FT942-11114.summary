Title:  FT 06 MAY 94 Survey of The Channel Tunnel 16 Big potential benefits Belgium looks for economic spin offs 
 The official opening of the Channel Tunnel later this year promises to help revitalise the north west regions of Belgium even though the country s biggest ports will suffer a loss of traffic
The chambers of commerce in Veurne and Courtrai along with the West Flanders Regional Development Authority in Bruges are gearing up to become part of what they refer to as the new European Metropolitan Area
According to Mr Anthony Vande Candelare an urban planner who made a study of the influence of the Channel Tunnel on the west of Belgium and the North of France Overnight the Belgian coast and the North of France will become the centre of Europe
Mr Jo Libeer managing director of the Courtrai chamber of commerce is equally optimistic about the likely impact on the area of the tunnel
With the TGV and the chunnel this region which was sort of in the corner of Europe will now be in the middle of a new developing area he says
Furthermore Flanders the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of the tunnel has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than in Wallonia and the Brussels region
The Belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are two main areas for development firstly increasing traffic through western Flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel opening in Calais and secondly tourism
There is however a danger that Belgium will not make the most of the commercial opportunities we will try to attract new industry but our region is very small and our industrial zones are full says Mr Ludo Verstraete of the Veurne chamber of commerce
