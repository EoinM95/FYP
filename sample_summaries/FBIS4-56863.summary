Title:  Shining Path To Continue People s War 
 The Shining Path Central Committee comprised of leaders who have still not been arrested and alternate members elected by the Shining Path congress in 1988 held a meeting in February that was presided over by Oscar Ramirez Durand aka Comrade Feliciano
During the meeting the Shining Path Central Committee decided to continue the people s war and to consider those members who uphold the peace accord with the government to be removed from the party by their own free will
The document entitled To Grow Strong on the Grounds of Partisan Unity and Conquer Power [Reafirmarse en la Base de Unidad Partidaria y Construir la Conquesta del Power] which contains the conclusions of the Shining Path event criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating to uphold the great decision and definition that is Abimael Guzman s appeal for the Shining Path to end hostilities against the Peruvian state
A Shining Path pamphlet dated February which is signed by the leaders under arrest asserts that the people s war has ended and therefore to continue refusing to uphold the great decision and definition means obstructing the Peace Accord and placing the life of President Gonzalo and other comrades at stake
Dincote also obtained information according to which Feliciano presided over the meeting during which it was decided to start a new phase of the people s war as well as plan an operation to rescue Abimael Guzman dead or alive at any cost
The following is one of the citations chosen by the Shining Path Central Committee to uphold its decisions Always taking into account the glorious actions of the people s war the people s war cannot end
This was selected from the document entitled To Conquer Power in the Midst of the People s War that was drafted during the Second Shining Path Central Committee Plenum when Guzman was still free
The second point of the document of the Central Committee meeting presided over by Feliciano highlights the agreements of the Working Meeting of the Shining Path leadership held in August 1993 almost one year after Guzman was arrested and during which the implementation of the agreements of the Third Plenum held in March 1992 was discussed
In order to confront the Black Group or LOD which are nothing but Shining Path militants who sign Abimael Guzman s letters and uphold his great decision and definition to negotiate with the government in order to end the war the Central Committee demands that the militants grow stronger on the Basis for Partisan Unity [Base de Unidad Partidaria BUP] which is the Shining Path basic principles adopted during the 1988 Congress and arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people s war
