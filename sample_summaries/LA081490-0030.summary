Title:  WILDFIRE CREWS PAY A HEAVY PRICE IN HEALTH 
 The 80 000 men and women who battle the nation s wildfires have always known their lives were endangered by flames or heat or falling debris
But now two new studies show they also face an unseen hazard Their health is under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke
Among the culprits are carbon monoxide which slows reaction and impairs judgment microscopic particles of carbon that lodge in the lungs aldehydes and acids that irritate air passages and hydrocarbon based substances and other chemicals that can damage genes and cause cancer tests show
Wildland firefighters whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering their faces lose as much as 10 of their lung capacity after one routine season and the damage persists for weeks according to the studies by the California Department of Health Services and the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore
Combined the researchers tested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and after the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons
Health experts also suspect that exposure to wildfire smoke may accelerate aging prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma
But our studies show their lungs aren t back to normal said Dr. Robert Harrison the California health department s chief of occupational health surveillance and the physician in charge of one of the studies
The worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals which can be fatal are given off when fires smolder the stage in which firefighters spend most of their time said Darold Ward a US Forest Service chemist
Mark Linane who heads a national firefighting crew known as the Hotshots said he has seen wildland firefighters so poisoned by carbon monoxide that they can t decide which shoe to tie
The Yosemite fires which have scorched more than 15 000 acres and are still out of control and the recent Santa Barbara and Glendale fires which destroyed nearly 500 homes are only the largest of hundreds of blazes in the state
We ve got lots of summer ahead of us and we ve already burned 600 or 700 structures said Deputy Chief Keith Metcalfe of the state s southern regional firefighting crew in Riverside. . . 
For nearly 10 years urban firefighters have known that toxic smoke from burning structures and cars greatly increases their chances of cancer and heart disease
But the US Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke
But because no mortality studies have been funded all they have is the old joke heard around the fire camp Just try to find a wildland firefighter still breathing after 60
It s a crime that we continue to let these guys function like this said James Johnson director of hazard control projects at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Northern California which is developing respiratory gear for its firefighters
The Johns Hopkins tests conducted on 52 Northern California wildland firefighters during the 1988 season showed that their lung function or flow of oxygen remained reduced by as much as 3 even eight weeks after exposure
Although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published word has spread to top officials in the state Forestry Department who say they are now starting to search for protection for the agency s 3 500 full time firefighters and about 2 000 seasonal ones
Air tanks and masks that are standard for fighting structural fires weigh 40 pounds and last only 15 to 30 minutes so they are impractical for wildfire crews that hike miles carrying as much as 60 pounds of hoses and tools
