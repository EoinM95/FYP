Title:  FT 06 SEP 94 Commodities and Agriculture De Beers digs deeper into its resources The new lease of life for the Jwaneng and Finsch diamond mines 
 The Jwaneng mine on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana is known as a gem in the world of gems because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields
Meanwhile 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South Africa another diamond mine the Finsch where operations started in 1964 has been given a new lease of life
All this goes to show that De Beers the South African group that dominates world trade in rough uncut diamonds still has complete faith in its ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short term difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with Russia
The South African group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate with the other producers who have marketing contracts with De Beers Central Selling Organisation In Botswana De Beers controls half of Debswana the company that owns the Jwaneng mine with the government owning the rest
