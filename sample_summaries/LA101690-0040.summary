 Tuberculosis has become the world s deadliest infectious disease and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly the World Health Organization said Monday
The UN agency in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a decade said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year most of them between the ages of 15 and 59 the segment of the population that is economically most productive
It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV which causes AIDS and tuberculosis
The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be infected with HIV by the year 2000 and it predicted that the number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result especially in sub Saharan Africa Latin America and Southeast Asia
