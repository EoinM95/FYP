Title:  ARMY GIVES ULTIMATUM TO SLOVENIA FEDERAL FORCES THREATEN ATTACK AS CEASE FIRE AGREEMENT FALTERS 
 His statement just a day after both sides agreed to a cease fire indicated that a plan to resolve the state s ethnic political and economic disputes had gone off the rails less than 18 hours after it was accepted
The ultimatum also appeared to confirm Slovenian fears that the army is acting outside government control in its effort to subjugate the secessionist republic
Mesic election was key Mesic s election was the political keystone in the peace plan which also called for the federal troops in Slovenia to return to the barracks and for a three month delay by the breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia in carrying out their independence declarations
The Tanjug news agency reported that 200 000 Serbs were expected to join a territorial militia in Serbia the biggest Yugoslav republic which opposes independence for Slovenia and Croatia and Negovanovic said Croatia had ordered a mobilization of its police reserves
Urgent legislative meeting Slovenia s parliament was called into emergency session after a 12 point list of demands from the army was presented to republic leaders insisting that all impediments to federal army operations be removed as part of a Western brokered cease fire
The peace package was assembled by federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic brokered by an emergency mission of the European Community and accepted by the leaders of Slovenia and Croatia as well as Serbia
But Saturday night Markovic charged that Slovenia s President Milan Kucan had torpedoed the plan by insisting that the moratorium on independence had to be approved by his parliament to take effect
Condition upon condition Milosevic seizing on Kucan s statement insisted that Serbia would not allow Mesic to become president in the normal rotation until the Slovenian and Croatian parliaments agreed to the moratorium
The Slovenian government charged the army with repeated breaches of the cease fire and demanded the surrender of army units and installations that Slovenian forces had surrounded and cut off since the fighting began Thursday
At the end of the day the maneuvering by all three republics ensured a prolongation of the crisis that has deprived the country of a civilian commander in chief for more than six weeks and effectively left the army to make its own moves
