Title:  JOHNSON SECOND IN FIRST RACE SINCE BAN 
 His time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75 second time of Daron Council a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for the Alachua County Fla. sheriff s department
The brief race produced a record crowd of 17 050 and drew nearly 500 journalists from 14 countries in North America Europe and Asia
They were attracted by the return of Johnson whose day of infamy Sept. 24 1988 has assured him a millennium of fame
He would merely have been a gold medalist if a positive test at the 1988 Olympics had not turned him into the most vilified champion in the history of the Games
It also led to the two year suspension from the sport that made an epic event of Johnson s race Friday
Johnson got off to an uncharacteristically slow start and finished second by a few inches to Council
