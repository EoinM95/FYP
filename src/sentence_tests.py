        extremely active. One important task in this field is automatic summarization\n\
        which consists of reducing the size of a text while preserving its information content [9], [21]. A summarizer is a\n\
        system that produces a condensed representation of its inputâ€™s for user consumption\n\
        [12]. Summary construction is, in general, a complex task which ideally would involve\n\
        deep natural language processing capacities [15]. In order to simplify the problem,\n\
        current research is focused on extractive-summary generation [21]. An extractive\n\
        summary is simply a subset of the sentences of the original text. These summaries do\n\
        not guarantee a good narrative coherence, but they can conveniently represent an\n\
        approximate content of the text for relevance judgement."
